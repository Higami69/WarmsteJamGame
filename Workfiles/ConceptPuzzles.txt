- need parts for terraformer
	- purified water
		-how can you find clean water in a wasteland?
			- look for parts to pump water out of soil?

	- computer chip -> to be found in ruins?
				- some kind of old tech center
					- find clearance in lab to get through the door
	

- geiser: destroy a rock in order to let the pressure push you in a direction
							- could be used to push up to higher places
							- to push something down
							- chain reaction of rubble coming down
							- geiser to be used to power an engine using a tube
								-twist: tube is missing from the generator -> generator pumps up water to be used in terraformer



- find way to climb over edge (of ruins?)
	-find rock to use to jump over
	- break wall with explosives
		-twist: use geiser to push a rock through a wall :thinking:


to find stuff: sound radar?
